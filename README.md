# My personal [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) packages

This repo contains all software I've packaged and has been uploaded to Archlinux User Repository.

## Important

All packages are managed from cli using eli-schartz's [aurpublish](https://github.com/eli-schwartz/aurpublish) tool. The most important thing to take account is that I must **first pull AUR repo to my local machine** using `aurpublish -p <package>` (placed on my local AUR-packages folder) before do any change, **AUR git repo has got much more strict policy about revert commits.**
